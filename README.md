# Validating Forms with Zod and React-Hook-Form

**Forms allow you to collect user data on your websites and apps. And validation is essential to guarantee type safety and the proper format for collected data. You can perform validation on both the client and server side of the application.**

This is where Zod and React-Hook-Form come in as a dynamic duo, ready to take your forms to the next level.

Zod is a validation library that provides a concise and expressive syntax for defining data schemas, making it an excellent choice for validating form data.

On the other hand, [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is a lightweight form library for React that embraces uncontrolled components and simplifies form-building with its intuitive hooks-based API.
